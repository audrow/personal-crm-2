# RECORDS

## 2022-04-15

I've started a basic project, and now, there are a few things left to do:

- Get up and running with React Testing Library on components
- Make the core components for the app
- Integrate those components into an application
- Setup Supabase locally
- Create the appropriate data structures in Supabase
- Deploy the site on Supabase
