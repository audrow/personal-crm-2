Alright, so I have some idea of how to do tests for components. I think that I can figure it out from here. Should I dig into integration tests? I don't think so yet.

Probably a good way to proceed with this project is to build and test all of the components. From there, I can connect it to Supabase, which is fairly easy and add integration tests.

I also think it would be good to learn Figma, to get an idea of how to do design related things.

I've started a basic project, and now, there are a few things left to do:

- Get up and running with React Testing Library on components
- Make the core components for the app
- Integrate those components into an application
- Setup Supabase locally
- Create the appropriate data structures in Supabase
- Deploy the site on Supabase
